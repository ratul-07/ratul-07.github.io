title: "An Empirical Study of Machine Learning Techniques for ODI Bowler Performance Evaluation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/2024-ODI-Ranking-C3IT
excerpt: |
  The objective of the paper is to construct an innovative ranking system based on various Machine Learning (ML) techniques specifically tailored for One Day International (ODI) male players.
  It aims to create a recommender system that produces bowler rankings closely aligned with the International Cricket Council (ICC) Rankings, with a focus on enhancing accuracy and reliability.
  The dataset encompasses a wide range of match parameters, performance metrics, and player statistics, providing a comprehensive foundation for insightful analysis.
  By employing data-driven techniques, the paper aims to highlight key performance indicators that significantly influence bowler rankings.
  We performed an analysis among five machine learning models that can produce rankings of bowlers and selected the best model whose predictions are closest to the ICC's official rankings.
  The rankings obtained from the five machine learning algorithms have been compared with the ICC rankings utilizing the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient.
  The results highlight that Artificial Neural Networks (Multi-Layered Perceptron) exhibit the best outcome with a rank correlation coefficient of 0.7550.
