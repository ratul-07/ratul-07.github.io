ðŸŽ“ I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering from Academy of Technology, Hooghly.

ðŸ’» My interests include Data Science, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Gen-AI.

ðŸ“˜ I'm currently working on building strong foundations to deep dive into the worlds of LLMs and Gen-AI.

ðŸ“ƒ I'm also interested in collaborating with folks for research publications in the field of Data Science

## Research Experience

I have experience in group research during my Bachelor's Thesis, where I have used various machine learning models to replicate the behaviour and working of the popular
ranking system of ICC (International Cricket Council) to rank cricket bowlers in the One Day International format. Moreover I have presented the respective paper in the 4th International Conference
on Computer, Communication, Control and Information Technology 2024 [C3IT], IEEE, 2024. You can find more details about the conference [here](https://c3it2024.aot.edu.in/#about).
